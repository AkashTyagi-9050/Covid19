Problems:

--> Found data quality issues, fix missing and inconsistent values.
--> tests, avg_mobility have ~50% missing values
--> Found Several very small territories (Antarctica, Bouvet Island, etc.) show only 24 rows and many NaNs for the above columns.
	country_name, year, and month are complete (no NaNs).
--> Convert integer-like float columns to more efficient integer types (int32).


Solutions:

# Added 3 columns infection_rate (%), positivity_rate (%) and date. Which can be used for future analysis.

# tests, vaccinations and avg_mobility have many NaN value filled it with 0.

# Removed the countries where max columns has Nan values. 

# changed data types for columns ( confirmed, deaths, tests, vaccinations, elderly_pop, population ) having float data types changed it to integer
